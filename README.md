# osx-river-widget
A simple OSX dashboard widget to display current river flow data.

Currently hard coded to the Truckee River in Reno, Nevada, but would be easy to generalize.

## Build and Install

Run the `bin/build.sh` bash script to create `dist/Truckee River Reno.wdgt`. 
Double click that in the OS X Finder to install the widget.
